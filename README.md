Summary:
In this project, Tomato plant is mainly used for model training and testing. 
This project have experimented on plant image data set and tomato growing stages. 
Experimental results are compared with state of the architectures like Mobile Net, Dark Net-19, ResNet-101 and proposed model out performs in location. Obtains best results in computation and accuracy.
